# Data Directory

This directory contains data files for the starter module in Hugo. In Hugo, the data directory is used to store structured data files that can be used throughout your site templates.

Hugo supports data files in YAML, TOML, JSON, and XML formats. These files can contain configurations, settings, or any structured data that you want to use in your templates without hardcoding them.

Data stored in this directory can be accessed in templates using the `.Site.Data` variable, making it easy to separate content from configuration and presentation logic.

For more information on how Hugo handles data files, refer to the [Hugo documentation on Data Templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/).
