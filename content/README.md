# Content Directory

This directory contains all the content files for the starter module in Hugo. In Hugo, content files are primarily written in Markdown format and represent the actual content of your website.

Content files in Hugo have front matter (metadata) typically defined at the top of the file in YAML, TOML, or JSON format, followed by the main content in Markdown format. This front matter defines properties like title, date, tags, categories, and other custom parameters.

Content is organized in a directory structure that typically mirrors your site's URL structure. Each content file becomes a page on your Hugo site.

For more information on how Hugo handles content, refer to the [Hugo documentation on Content Management](https://gohugo.io/content-management/).
