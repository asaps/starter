# Assets Directory

This directory contains all the assets for the starter module in Hugo. In Hugo, assets are files that can be processed by Hugo Pipes, such as CSS, SASS, JavaScript, images, and other files that require processing before deployment.

Assets stored here can be accessed and processed via Hugo's built-in asset processing capabilities, allowing for operations like SASS compilation, minification, bundling, fingerprinting, and more.

For more information on how Hugo handles assets, refer to the [Hugo documentation on Asset Processing](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/).
