# Themes Directory

This directory contains themes for the starter module in Hugo. In Hugo, themes are pre-packaged collections of layouts, styles, and assets that can be applied to your site to provide a complete visual design.

Hugo themes typically include templates, stylesheets, JavaScript, and other assets organized in a specific structure that Hugo understands. Themes can be developed specifically for your site, installed from external sources, or created as a starting point for further customization.

The themes directory can contain multiple themes, and you can specify which theme to use in your site's configuration file (config.toml, config.yaml, or config.json). Hugo also supports theme composition, allowing you to use multiple themes together.

For more information on how Hugo handles themes, refer to the [Hugo documentation on Themes](https://gohugo.io/themes/).
