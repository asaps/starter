# i18n Directory

This directory contains internationalization (i18n) files for the starter module in Hugo. In Hugo, i18n files are used to store translations for your site.

Hugo's i18n system allows you to create multilingual websites by defining translation strings in YAML, TOML, or JSON format. These translation files contain key-value pairs where the key is the string identifier and the value is the translated text for a specific language.

These translations can be accessed in templates using the `i18n` function or the `.Translate` method, allowing you to provide localized content to users based on their language preference.

For more information on how Hugo handles internationalization, refer to the [Hugo documentation on Multilingual Mode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/).
